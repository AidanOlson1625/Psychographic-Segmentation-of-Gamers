# Psychographic-Segmentation-of-Gamers

This project has a pdf and a Jupyter notebook. The pdf is a paper made with LaTeX containing figures and descriptive narration of the project. The Jupyter notebook has code with supplimentary commentary on the direction of the project. For a preview, read the abstract. Enjoy!

ABSTRACT:

In this project I initially sought to understand what makes a video game suc- cessful according to Review Score, Sales, Genre, and various measurements of Gameplay Time. I found that depending on how the data is represented, there emerge two completely opposing conclusions backed by equally convincing data. I found that Review Score and Gameplay Time both do and do not matter in the success of a game. I later determined this constituted a psychographic segmentation among gamers.
I found two player bases who appear to behave in opposite ways: one player base buys games according to how they score on a rating scale. Consequently, these players buy a game solely based on reviews and, subsequently, the quality of its gameplay. The other player base cares less about reviews and gameplay quality. These players seem to favor games with multiplayer features and shorter gameplay time. We can even draw connections between how these differing behaviors cause them to gravitate toward different genres.
